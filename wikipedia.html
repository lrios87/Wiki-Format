    <h1>Welcome to <a href="#">Wikipedia</a>,</h1>
    <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="#">Belgian national football team </a> has represented <a href="#">Belgium</a> in <a href="#">association
      football</a> since their <a href="#">maiden match</a> in 1904. The squad is supervised by the
      <a href="#">Royal Belgian Football Association</a>, stands under the global jurisdiction
      of <a href="#">FIFA</a> and is governed in Europe by <a href="#">UEFA</a>. Most of their home games are
      played at the <a href="#">King Baudouin Stadium</a>in Brussels. The squad has been known
      as the Red Devils since 1906; its fan club is named "1895". Belgium has
      long-standing football rivalries with its Dutch and French counterparts,
      having played both teams nearly every year from 1905 to 1967. Periods of
      regular Belgian representation at the highest international level, from
      1920 to 1938, and 1970 to 2002, have alternated with mostly unsuccessful
      qualification rounds. The national team played in three Olympic football
      tournaments, including the one in <a href="#">1920</a>, which they won. They achieved
      victories over four <a href="#">reigning world champions</a>—West Germany, Brazil,
      Argentina and France—between 1954 and 2002. Belgium topped the <a href="#">FIFA World
      Rankings</a> for the first time in November 2015. They are competing in the
      <a href="#">European qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup</a>, which will run until October 2017.
